There is a single data file, called ba-data.dat, which is zipped in the file
ba-data.zip. The file is an ASCII file in DOS format. When unzipping it on a
Unix system, use "unzip -a".

Filesize: 4046901 (Unix format)
          4183275 (DOS format)

The file is organized as columns separated by spaces. The data are a cross
section of households, and the columns are variables. The number of records
is 136374. Min record length=7 and max=105.

Number of observations=9741
Number of variables=700

Source of data: Household Income and Expenditure Survey, Government of 
Pakistan.

Variable definitions:

hhcode   = household ID
fdsh     = share of food expenditure in household budget
lsize    = log of household size
lpcexp   = log of per capita expenditure of household
lpcexpsq = square of lpcexp
lpcinc   = log of per capita income of household
lpcincsq = square of lpcinc
mksh     = share of milk expenditure in household budget
chsh     = share of budget spent on "child goods"
adsh     = share of budget spent on "adult goods"
dp       = dummy variable that is 1 if province=Punjab
dn       = dummy variable that is 1 if province=NWFP
ds       = dummy variable that is 1 if province=Sind
dq1      = dummy variable that is 1 if quarter=1
dq2      = dummy variable that is 1 if quarter=1
dq3      = dummy variable that is 1 if quarter=1
dq4      = dummy variable that is 1 if quarter=1
dmorder  = birth order dummy for males
           (dmorder is defined as 1 if there exists a male child in the hh)
dforder  = birth order dummy for females
hhhlit   = literacy (0/1) of household head
hhslit   = literacy (0/1) of household head's spouse

prpm(i)  = number of males of age i as a proportion of total hh size.
prpf(i)  = number of females of age i as a proportion of total hh size.
wprpm(i) = number of working males of age i as propn. of hhsize
wprpf(i) = number of working females of age i as propn of hhsize
dprpm(i) = number of dependent males of age i as a propn of hhsize
dprpf(i) = number of dependent females of age i as a propn of hhsize

(NB: wprpm(i)+dprpm(i)=prpm(i), ie propn working males + propn dependent
males = propn males.)

pmwork(i) = number of working males of age-group i as a proportion of hhsize.
pfwork(i) = number of working females of age-group i as a proportion of 
            hhsize. 
pmdept(i) = number of dependent males of age-group i as a proportion of hhsize.
pfdept(i) = number of dependent females of age-group i as a proportion of 
            hhsize.
